# ANN for Regression
 
## Objective
In this repo I have built an ANN for regression on a sinusoidal function, also the performance of utilize the Batch Gradient Ddescend and Minibatch Gradient Descend has been compared.

## Steps
1. Generate artificial data
3. Build and Train ANN Model
4. Apply Batch Gradient Ddescend and Minibatch Gradient Descend
5. Analyze the Results
